# From Nand To Tetris

This repository contains my own work during studying this course and all my project files.

The Nand2Tetris course is a hands-on, project-based course that takes us through the process of building a modern computer system from the ground up. The course teaches the fundamental principles and techniques used in computer hardware and software design.

The site contains all the lectures, project materials and tools necessary for building a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up.

## My Progress ✔️

### Week 1

Constructing various basic logic gates in HDL such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Along with more complex ones like Multiplixers and Demultiplixers. The goal was to understand the basic building blocks of digital logic circuits and learn how to use the HDL language to describe and simulate their behavior.
