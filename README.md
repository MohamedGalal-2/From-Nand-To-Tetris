### About the Course
The Nand2tetris course is an online course that aims to teach students how to build a complete computer system from the ground up, starting from the basic building block of logic gates (specifically the NAND gate) and working their way up to high-level programming. The course is divided into two parts: hardware and software.

1. The hardware part of the course focuses on the design and construction of the computer's hardware components, including logic gates, arithmetic units, memory units, CPU, and the computer's input/output devices. Students learn about digital logic design, computer architecture, and hardware description languages.

2. The software part of the course focuses on the development of a software stack for the computer, including an assembler, virtual machine, and high-level programming language. Students also learn about compiler construction, operating systems, and algorithms.

Throughout the course, students work on building a virtual computer called Hack, which is accompanied by a software simulator. Each module of the course introduces new concepts and challenges, building upon the knowledge and skills acquired in previous modules.

By the end of the course, students will have created a complete, functioning computer system, from low-level hardware components to high-level software programs. The Nand2tetris course provides a comprehensive understanding of computer systems and is suitable for beginners and advanced learners alike.

### Description
This GitHub repository serves as a home for all the code done by me to this project. It includes a step-by-step guide, along with all the necessary code, documentation, and additional resources. The project follows a top-down approach, making it accessible for individuals with various levels of programming knowledge.

### My Progress
#### Week 1 ✔️

Constructing various basic logic gates in HDL such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Along with more complex ones like Multiplixers and Demultiplixers. The goal was to understand the basic building blocks of digital logic circuits and learn how to use the HDL language to describe and simulate their behavior.
