# From Nand To Tetris

This repository contains my own work during studying this course and all my project files.

The Nand2Tetris course is a hands-on, project-based course that takes us through the process of building a modern computer system from the ground up. The course teaches the fundamental principles and techniques used in computer hardware and software design.

* Course website: http://nand2tetris.org/

The site contains all the lectures, project materials and tools necessary for building a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up.
